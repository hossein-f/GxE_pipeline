# GxE-pipeline
This repo contains scripts that comprise the Gene Environment Interaction (GxE) pipeline, for alignment & statistical modeling of allelic imbalances in RNA-Seq data across many cellular environments.

## Outline
### I. Align RNA-seq reads and perform QC
  * 1.) Create directories, symbolic link to fastqs, and distribute scripts for alignment
  * 2.) Align reads, merge across barcodes, & do read counts
  * 3.) Combine read counts from all stages of filtering
  * 4.) Gene counts using DESeq2
  * 5.) Make pileups for QuASAR

### II. QuASAR (EM) pipeline to infer individual ASE
<https://github.com/piquelab/GxE_pipeline/tree/master/QuASAR_pipeline>
  * 6.) Create directories, symbolic link to pileups, and distribute scripts for QuASAR
  * 7.) Run the QuASAR pipeline for joint genotyping ASE inference   

### II. MESH (MCMC) to infer condition specific ASE
  * 8.) Create directories, setup the master table, and distribute scripts for MESH 
  * 9.) Combine QuASAR data into a master table and process data for MESH
  * 10.) Split master table data on logFC for MESH analysis
  * 11.) Run the MESH pipeline for condition specific ASE

### V. Multiclass logistic regression on MESH output and DESeq2 counts 
  * 12.) Run multiclass logistic regression

## Notes
  * I is performed per plate, so we will use DP1 as an example. All other plates can be processed similarly by replacing DP1 with the desired plate.
